= Configuring Octavia

Kuryr SDN uses OpenStack Octavia LBaaS to implement OpenShift Services. Thus,
you must install and configure Octavia components in your OpenStack environment
to use Kuryr SDN.

To enable Octavia, you must include the Octavia Service during the installation
of the OpenStack Overcloud, or upgrade the Octavia Service if the Overcloud
already exists. The following steps for enabling Octavia apply to both a clean
install of the Overcloud or an Overcloud update.

[NOTE]
====
The following steps only capture the key pieces required during the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html/director_installation_and_usage/[deployment of OpenStack]
when dealing with Octavia. It is also important to note that
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html/director_installation_and_usage/configuring-a-container-image-source#registry-methods[registry methods]
vary.

This example uses the local registry method.
====

.Procedure

. If you are using the local registry, create a template to upload the images to
the registry. For example:
+
----
(undercloud) $ openstack overcloud container image prepare \
-e /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/environments/services-docker/octavia.yaml \
--namespace=registry.access.redhat.com/rhosp13 \
--push-destination=<local-ip-from-undercloud.conf>:8787 \
--prefix=openstack- \
--tag-from-label {version}-{release} \
--output-env-file=/home/stack/templates/overcloud_images.yaml \
--output-images-file /home/stack/local_registry_images.yaml
----

. Verify that the `local_registry_images.yaml` file contains the Octavia images.
For example:
+
----
...
- imagename: registry.access.redhat.com/rhosp13/openstack-octavia-api:13.0-43
  push_destination: <local-ip-from-undercloud.conf>:8787
- imagename: registry.access.redhat.com/rhosp13/openstack-octavia-health-manager:13.0-45
  push_destination: <local-ip-from-undercloud.conf>:8787
- imagename: registry.access.redhat.com/rhosp13/openstack-octavia-housekeeping:13.0-45
  push_destination: <local-ip-from-undercloud.conf>:8787
- imagename: registry.access.redhat.com/rhosp13/openstack-octavia-worker:13.0-44
  push_destination: <local-ip-from-undercloud.conf>:8787
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The Octavia container versions vary depending upon the specific
{rh-openstack} release installed.
====

. Pull the container images from registry.redhat.io to the Undercloud node:
+
----
(undercloud) $ sudo openstack overcloud container image upload \
  --config-file  /home/stack/local_registry_images.yaml \
  --verbose
----
+
This may take some time depending on the speed of your network and Undercloud
disk.

. Since an Octavia load balancer is used to access the OpenShift API, you must
increase their listeners' default timeouts for the connections. The default
timeout is 50 seconds. Increase the timeout to 20 minutes by passing the
following file to the Overcloud deploy command:
+
----
(undercloud) $ cat octavia_timeouts.yaml
parameter_defaults:
  OctaviaTimeoutClientData: 1200000
  OctaviaTimeoutMemberData: 1200000
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This is not needed for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 14+.
====

. Install or update your Overcloud environment with Octavia:
+
----
openstack overcloud deploy --templates \
  -e /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/environments/services-docker/octavia.yaml \
  -e octavia_timeouts.yaml
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This command only includes the files associated with Octavia; it varies based on
your specific installation of OpenStack. See the official OpenStack
documentation for further information. For more information on customizing your
Octavia installation, see
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html-single/networking_guide/#planning_your_octavia_deployment[installation
of Octavia using Director].
====
+
[NOTE]
====
When leveraging Kuryr SDN, the Overcloud installation requires the Neutron `trunk` extension. This is available by default on Director deployments.
Use the `openvswitch` firewall instead of the default `ovs-hybrid` when the Neutron
backend is ML2/OVS. There is no need for modifications if the backend is
ML2/OVN.
====

. In {rh-openstack} versions 13 and 15, add the project ID
to the `octavia.conf` configuration file after you create the project. 
* To enforce
network policies across Services, like when traffic goes through
the Octavia load balancer, you must ensure Octavia creates the Amphora VM
security groups on the user project.
+
This change ensures that required LoadBalancer security groups belong to that project,
and that they can be updated to enforce Services isolation.
+
[NOTE]
====
This task is unnecessary in {rh-openstack} version 16 or later.
Octavia implements a new ACL API that restricts access to the Load
Balancers VIP.

[NOTE]
====
Depending on your OpenStack environment, Octavia might not support UDP
listeners, which means there is no support for UDP Services if Kuryr SDN is
used.
