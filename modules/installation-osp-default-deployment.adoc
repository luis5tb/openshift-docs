= Resource guidelines for installing {product-title} on OpenStack

Your quota must meet the following requirements to run the {product-title}
installation program in {rh-openstack-first}.

.Recommended resources for a default {product-title} cluster on {rh-openstack}

|================================

[NOTE]
Swift space requirements vary depending on the size of the bootstrap Ignition file and image registry.

A cluster might function with fewer than recommended resources, but its performance is not guaranteed.

[NOTE]
By default, your security group and security group rule quotas might be low. If you encounter problems, run `openstack quota set --secgroups 3 --secgroup-rules 60 <project>` to increase them.

If you plan to use Kuryr SDN, there are additional requirements, like
specifying a larger quota for {rh-openstack}:
xref:./installation-osp-default-kuryr-deployment.adoc#installation-osp-default-kuryr-deployment[Kuryr {rh-openstack} requirements.]

An {product-title} deployment comprises control plane machines, compute machines, and a bootstrap machine.

[id="control-compute-machines_{context}"]
== Control plane and compute machines

By default, the {product-title} installation program stands up three control plane and compute machines.

Each machine requires:

* An instance from the {rh-openstack} quota
* A port from the {rh-openstack} quota
* A flavor with at least 16 GB memory, 4 vCPUs, and 25 GB storage space

[TIP]
Compute machines host the applications that you run on {product-title}; aim to run as many as you can.

// == Compute machines

// By default, the {product-title} installation program stands up three compute machines.

// What about instances and ports?
// Each worker node requires:

// * An instance from the {rh-openstack} quota
// * A port from the {rh-openstack} quota
// * A flavor with at least 16 GB memory, 4 vCPUs, and 25 GB storage space

// Each compute machine requires a flavor with at least 8 GB memory, 2 vCPUs, and 25 GB storage space.

[id="bootstrap-machines_{context}"]
== Bootstrap machine

At installation, a bootstrap machine is temporarily provisioned to stand up the control plane. After the production control plane is ready, the bootstrap machine is deprovisioned.

The bootstrap machine requires:

* An instance from the {rh-openstack} quota
* A port from the {rh-openstack} quota
* A flavor with at least 16 GB memory, 4 vCPUs, and 25 GB storage space

[NOTE]
The installation program cannot pass certificate authority bundles to Ignition on control plane machines. Therefore, the bootstrap machine cannot retrieve Ignition configurations from Swift if your endpoint uses self-signed certificates.
